# URLShorster

The application is a simplified version of a URL shortener. The server was created using Node.js along with Express and MongoDB, while the front-end was created using React.

## Prerequisites:
### Install Node.js
### Clone this repository to your machine
### cd into URLShorster folder
## Client Setup (React Front-End): 
### `cd client`
### `npm i` 
### `npm start` 

## Server Setup:
### `cd server`
### `npm i` 
### `npm install mongoose` to install mongoose for MongoDB
### `npm install --save-dev jest` to install jest for tests
### `nodemon index.js` to start server
### `npm test` to run tests

The front-end is available at: localhost:3000
The api is available at: localhost:8080

Redis cache still needs some work.
